##Approach--------
Thinking about the rules of blackjack I aimed to build a two person game between the
player and the dealer. Both people start with equal chips and the game is won/lost when
either person loses/collects all the chips.

At the window.onload event listeners connect the cards, hit, clear and dealer cards functions
to the viewed buttons.

My scope was to build two entities within the DOM where player cards, chips and current hand
score can be stored.

My initial goal was to build multiple constructors so that any functionality for one player
can be replicated easily to allow for the user to choose number of hands they wish to play.

##Unsolved Problems--------

When a card is dealt it isn't removed from the deck.
The dealers first card isn't shown at the start of each hand.
